\subsection{Boundary Check}

In this  section  we  discuss  how  to  determine if a point is located inside a
tetrahedron or not. This includes cases  where  vertices  of the tetrahedron are
located infinitely far away.

The easist case is  a  normal  tetrahedron with no infinite vertices. A 3D point
$\vec{x}$  is  located  inside  the  tetrahedron  if its barycentric coordinates
$\vec{\lambda}  =  \begin{bmatrix}  \lambda_1,  \lambda_2, \lambda_3,  \lambda_4
\end{bmatrix} \transpose$ satisfy the condition:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:boundary_check}
    0\le\lambda_n\le 1
\end{equation}

If one vertex is  located  in  infinity  then  one of the barycentric parameters
$\lambda_1$ will always equal 0. Therefore, we need  to additionally check which
side of  the  triangle, defined by $\vec{v_1}$, $\vec{v_2}$, and $\vec{v_3}$ the
point  $\vec{x}$ is being  projected  from.  The  following  condition  must  be
satisfied   in   addition    to    the    condition    described   in   equation
\ref{eq:boundary_check}

\begin{align}
    \left(\vec{v_2}-\vec{v_1}\right)\times\left(\vec{v_3}-\vec{v_1}\right) \odot \left(\vec{x}-\vec{v_1}\right) \ge 0
\end{align}

If  two vertices are located in infinity then two of the barycentric  parameters
$\lambda_{1,2}$ will always equal 0.
